    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div><p><br>Hi! My name is Victor Bautista. I am from Dominican Republic; a small island in the middle of the Caribbean, where summer lasts all year long and people wear sweaters if the temperature ever hits below 70 ˚F. I came to the United States just before starting the 10th grade and although I knew little to no English, my love for science and math made the transition easier than it is for most non native speakers.<br>
    
    My interest lies mainly within computer science and related fields such as math, engineering, finance and bioinformatics. I graduated from the College of Engineering at Cornell University with concentrations in Computer Science and Biological Engineering. I am fluent in several programming languages: Java, C++, C, Matlab, OCaml, Perl, CSS, PHP, HTML 5, Objective C(currently learning on my own). The purpose of this portfolio is to give you information about my programming experience, my personal qualifications, academic experience and leadership skills that I have developed thus far. For a look at some of the projects I have worked on, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/NaturalisSelectio" target="_blank" class="blue">Github account</a>. You can also take a look at my most recent <a href="file/resume.pdf" class="blue" target="_blank">resume</a>.<br>
    
    Outside of the classroom I am avid learner and I am always playing around with a new programming language. I believe being flexible in different languages gives you an edge when working in a team. It allows you to have a better understanding of different programming styles. I also play soccer, practice cross fit and I am currently learning different techniques for long distance swimming.<br>
    
    I believe that giving back is one of the most rewarding experiences that a person can have. I feel extremely grateful for the opportunities and abilities that I have been granted. One of my main passions is helping teenagers with their life choices. I believe that good guidance can go a long way. Guidance is one of the main aspects that young people in our society are missing nowadays. My other passion is to teach people how to code. With those two objectives in mind, I founded goodequality.com in March of 2014 and plan to have the beta version ready by June 20th, 2014. The website mainly focuses on guiding young people to and through college and enabling people with tools to learn how to code.<br>
    Life motto: Aggregation of Marginal Gains.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <div><p><br>I recently graduated from Cornell University(January 27th 2014 to be exact!) in the College of Engineering. The program of Independent Major in Engineering is quite excellent and allowed me to explore areas that overlapped each other while also learning the engineering core of each concentration. I focused on Computer Science and Biological Engineering and had the honor to work with two truly amazing and accomplished academics as my program advisors and mentors, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gries" target="_blank" class="red">David Gries</a> and <a href=“http://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/jean-hunter”><a href="http://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/jean-hunter" target="_blank" class="red">Jean Hunter</a>. Here are some of the most relevant classes from my program:<br>
      
      Object Oriented programming and data structures: Advanced programming in a high-level language and introduction to computer science. Topics included: program structure and organization, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis, recursion, data structures and simple graph algorithms. We only used java throughout the whole class.<br>
      
      Discreet Structures: Covers the mathematics that underlies most of computer science. Topics included: mathematical induction, logical proof, propositional and predicate calculus, combinatorics and discrete mathematics, basic probability theory, basic number theory, sets, functions, relations, graphs and finite-state machines.<br>
      
      Data Structures and Functional Programming: Advanced programming course that emphasizes functional programming techniques and data structures. Programming topics included: recursive and higher-order procedures, models of programming language evaluation and compilation, type systems, and polymorphism. Data structures and algorithms covered included graph algorithms, balanced trees, memory heaps, and garbage collection. Also covers techniques for analyzing program performance and correctness. We used OCAML for all the projects. Certainly the hardest class I have ever taken. <br>
      
      Computer System Organization and Programming: Introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the hardware/ software interface. Topics included: instruction sets, computer arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, I/O devices, bus-based I/O systems, and multicore architectures. We used LOGISIM and C++ for the projects.<br>
      
      Engineering Probability and Statistics: Gives students a working knowledge of basic probability and statistics and their application to engineering. Includes computer analysis of data and simulation. Topics included: random variables, probability distributions, expectation, estimation, testing, experimental design, quality control, and regression. <br>
      
      Bioinformatics Programming: An introductory course on tools and techniques for the analysis of molecular biological data, including biosequences, microarrays, and networks. We mostly used R and Perl for the projects and assingments. Topics included: sequence alignment, gene and motif finding, genome assembly, variant detection, demographic inference, detection of natural selection, association mapping, phylogeny reconstruction, microarray analysis, and methods for inferring and analyzing regulatory, protein-protein interaction, and metabolite networks.
